  	<h1>Teaching</h1>
  	<p> I private tutor for the UC Berkeley class CS70: Discrete Math and Probability Theory. Here is some feedback I've gotten from my tutees: 
        <ul>
            <li>"Making me redo the problems after getting to solution really helped."</li>
            <li>"Any confusing points were followed up on which was very helpful"</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
